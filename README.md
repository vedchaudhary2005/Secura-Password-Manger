# 🔐 Secura — Password Manager (React)

**Secura** is a simple and responsive **Password Manager** built using **React**.  
It allows users to **add, edit, delete, and copy** passwords — all stored locally for now.  
Currently, it’s a **frontend-only project**, and I’m learning **backend development (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)** to integrate it soon and make it full-stack.

## 🧠 About the Project

Secura is designed to help users manage multiple passwords easily with a clean and secure interface.  
All data is stored in **localStorage**, meaning your passwords are saved only in your browser — no external database yet.

This project helped me strengthen my **React fundamentals**, including:
- State management using `useState`
- Local storage handling with `useEffect`
- Managing form inputs and dynamic rendering
- Reusable components & responsive UI
